Classes we are considering at the moment

    Game.java
    Board.java
    Token.java

Planning
Our goal for this week is to setup the general frame work for connect 4 and be able to drop in a counter and know when the board is full. For the next few days we will go away and brain storm design ideas, approaches and to properly understand the spec. Hopefully by Wednesday weâ€™ll be able to meetup again, draw up the design together and allocate what needs to be written. We hope to finish checking for four in a row by the end of next week.

Possible uses and what functions we may need.

dropCounter() // action for dropping in counter
isBoardFull() // checking when all spots have been taken
gameWon() // checks if there is 4 in a row anywhere
isColFull() // check if column is full
isLegalMove() // confirms a move is legal
getTopCounter() // returns counter at top of column
whoIsAt() // reveals which counter/player is at (col n, row m)
getTokenType() // says if red or yellow token
